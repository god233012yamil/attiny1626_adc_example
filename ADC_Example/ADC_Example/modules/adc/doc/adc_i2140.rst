======================
ADC driver
======================

The Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) peripheral is a 12-bit differential and single-ended ADC, with a Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA), and a 
conversion rate up to 375 kHz at 12-bit resolution. 

The ADC is connected to an analog input multiplexer for selection between multiple single-ended or differential inputs. 

In single-ended conversions, the ADC measures the voltage between the selected input and 0V (GND). 

In differential conversions, the ADC measures the voltage between two selected inputs. The ADC inputs can be either internal (for example, a voltage reference) or
external analog input pins.

Operational Modes
------------------
* Single mode - Single conversion per trigger, with 8 or 12-bit conversion output
* Series Accumulation mode - One conversion per trigger, with accumulation of n samples
* Burst Accumulation mode - A burst with n samples accumulated as fast as possible after a single trigger

Features
--------
* 12-Bit Resolution Up to 17 bits with oversampling
* Conversion Rate Up to 375 kHz at 12-bit Resolution
* Differential and Single-Ended Conversion
* Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA) from 1x to 16x
* Single and Free-Running Conversions
* Series and Burst Accumulation Modes
* Optional Event Triggered Conversion
* Configurable Window Comparator

Applications
------------
* Periodic sampling of Input signals
* Series and Burst accumulations with scaling
* Sampling and measurement of a signal. E.g., sinusoidal wave, square wave.

Dependencies
------------
* ADC peripheral
* CLKCTRL/CLK for clock
* CPUINT/PMIC for Interrupt
* JTAG/PDI/UPDI for debug
* PORT for I/O Lines and Connections
* EVSYS for Events

Note
----
* ISR will be generated only when Global Interrupt checkbox and driver_isr Harness checkbox are enabled
